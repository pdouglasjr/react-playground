# NOTES

## useRef()
- built-in React hook
- accepts 1 argument -- *initialValue*
- has special property -- *current*

### 2 Rules to Remember About References
1. Value of reference is *persisted* (stays the same) between component renderings
2. Updating a reference *doesn't trigger a component re-rendering*
